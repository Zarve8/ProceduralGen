Simple block game called "life"
Use tkinker for visualization
Get init parameters
field_size -> number of blocks in one dimension
block_size -> number of pixels for each block in one dimension
space_size -> wide of pixels in each table board
delta_time -> delay between each stage(except time for calculating)
rand -> if set on true first list is set automatically by random numbers
	otherwise would read list from "DataList.txt"

# a bit buggy if field_size is not equal with actual size in input file
