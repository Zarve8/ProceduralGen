Simple realization of collapse of wave function in sudoku solution
In input.txt file get 9*9 blocks of integer, if any isn't specified at the start use 0 instead
In output.txt file give solution 9*9 for sudoku

Has no error back spread, so if the reached deadlock program starts from the start
If deadlock ended printed "deadlock: in terminal
In the output.txt file: * -> block has no possible values
		    'x -> block still can be  x possible values
		    x -> block is determined
